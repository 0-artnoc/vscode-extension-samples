# README
## This is the README for the "decorator-sample" 
-------------------

This folder contains a sample VS code extension that demonstrates the decorator API.

The sample creates a decoration for each number that appears in the active editor. It
demonstrates some of the decorator features such as borders, background colors, cursors
and hovers.
