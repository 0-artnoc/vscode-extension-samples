# Sample Guideline

Each sample should have the following components and structure, so that users could have a smooth experience when playing with the samples.

## 1: README

- 1.1: Each README should start with a short sentence / paragraph that describes what the extensions is and what it is meant to illustrate.
- 1.2: If the sample has a corresponding guide, it should link to the guide.
- 1.3: If the illustrated functionality is visual, a gif/image should follow the explanation. (File should be demo.png/gif/jpg. Use Dark+ theme)
- 1.4: A `Running the sample` section should describe the actions to run the sample.
  - 1.4.1: Mostly, it should be: Open this sample in VS Code -> `npm install && npm compile` -> Run `Launch Sample` target.
