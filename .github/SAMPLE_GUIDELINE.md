# Sample Guideline

Each sample should have the following components and structure, so that users could have a smooth experience when playing with the samples.

## README

- Each README should start with a short sentence / paragraph that describes what the extensions is and what it is meant to illustrate.
- If the sample has a corresponding guide, it should link to the guide.
- If the illustrated functionality is visual, a gif/image should follow the explanation.
- A `Running the sample` section should describe the actions to run the sample.
  - Mostly, it should be: Open this sample in VS Code -> `npm install && npm compile` -> Run `Launch Sample` target.
