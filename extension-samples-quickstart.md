# Welcome to the extension samples

## What's here
* These folders contain sample [VS Code extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/overview) that demonstrate various extension APIs.

## Get up and running straight away 
* Launch `npm install` in terminal in the root folder to initialize all samples
* Open the debug view and select the sample to launch
* set breakpoints inside a sample's `extension.ts` to debug an extension
* find output from your extension in the debug console

## Make changes
* you can relaunch a sample from the debug toolbar after changing code in `extension.ts`
* you can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes

## Explore the API
* you can open the full set of our API when you open the file node_modules/vscode/vscode.d.ts in each
sample
