# Welcome to the decorator sample

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains a sample VS code extensions that demonstrates various API avaiable to VS code
extensions.

## Get up and running straight away 
* Launch `npm run init` in terminal in the root folder to initialize all samples
* Open the debug view and select the sample to launch
* set breakpoints in your code inside the samples extension.ts to debug an extension
* find output from your extension in the debug console

## Make changes
* you can relaunch a sample from the debug toolbar after changing code in extension.ts
* you can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes

## Explore the API
* you can open the full set of our API when you open the file node_modules/vscode/vscode.d.ts in each
sample
